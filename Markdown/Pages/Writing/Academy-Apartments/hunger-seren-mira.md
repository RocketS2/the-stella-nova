Seren is at her limit.

Unable to anticipate how busy everyone's schedules would be, she's hardly had any opportunities to feed. She's eaten food, of course, but her thirst for blood has hardly been sated. Despite sharing a room, she's hardly had the time to see Voski, let alone feed off of her. Hungry, lonely, and perhaps something more, it was a relief to see Voski sitting on her apartment's couch.

She hardly noticed the yelp as she tackled her partner, tearing its shirt in a desperate attempt to get at her neck. Voski squirmed with calls of "Seren, Seren!" before letting out a moaning howl as Seren's fangs went in.

As her hunger became sated, Seren began to relax, and focus on other needs, such as making up for lost time. She ran a soft hand across Voski's face, fingers shifting through its beard. Their hands then dragged down slowly to its side, holding Voski in an embrace.

"A-are you okay, Seren?"

Only then did she realize the problem with her partner's mannerisms. Being so easily knocked over, the nerves, the taste, not reciprocating her movements. Seren quickly turned into a bat and flitted over to a chair. Having newly consumed blood, there was a deep red blush to her cheeks when she transforms back, standing out among her porcelain skin.

"I am so sorry, Mira. That was terrible of me."

Mira shot upwards, shifting into Tin's form and raising her hands defensively. "It's fine, it's my fault. You couldn't tell, and it seems like you really needed to eat."

"Mira, it's *my* responsibility to recognize my partner, and to stay lucid enough to properly ask to consume. What just happened is essentially assault."

"Seren, it's fine, really." There's a pleading tone to Mira's voice. "I don't want things to be awkward, and you didn't hurt me. You even thought to hug me, even if you were starving."

The blush fails to fade from Seren. "That...isn't typical, just something between myself and Voski. I usually just-actually, let me now." Seren heads into her room and comes back with a small black bag before sitting beside Mira.

"I usually just apply some disinfectant and a bandage while asking if it was fine." She says while opening the bag. "Do you mind if I do that?"

"I don't mind." Mira relaxes and allows Seren to work. "And...and I..." Mira hesitates, kicking her feet.

"Please, be honest. I don't want to force anything." Seren frowns as she applies a band-aid.

Mira averts her gaze. "I liked it. The tackle, the bite, the cuddling, it was all...nice. I'm sorry."

"Oh. *Oh.*" Seren shifts back, placing her things back in her bag. "I'm not sure how to feel about that, and I believe we both need more time to think. I'll buy you a new shirt, as well." 

"Right, thanks." Mira stands and heads back into her room, tripping over herself.

The next day, Mira hears a knock on her door in the afternoon, heavy and quick. She stands and shifts into Aria's form to open the door, finding Seren and Voski behind it.

"Hello, Mira. Do you have time to talk?" Seren did her best attempt at a comforting smile.

Mira tenses up, but nods. "Sure. Should this be in private?" She motions back towards her own room.

"That would be best." Seren follows Mira in, with Voski following after.

"Is it alright if we sit on the bed?" Voski speaks up, more mellow than usual. The two look to it, surprised, until Mira nods. Seren and Mira sit at the foot of the bed, while Voski lays herself across and behind them. "I'll let Seren take over."

"Right." Seren straightens up. "I wanted to talk about what happened yesterday. To start, are your...thoughts on it the same?" She fidgets with the hem of her dress, but managed to maintain eye contact.

Mira nods slowly, meeting Seren's gaze. "Yes, but we can pretend it didn't happen, I'm sorry, I-" 

Mira's interrupted by Voski sitting up and hugging her from behind. "It's alright, just relax. No one's mad." Voski smiles and coos as she holds Mira. "Let's hear what Serbear has to say, okay?"

Mira nods, leaning slightly into Voski's grasp as Seren looks on with pursed lips. 

"Right. I don't mind that you enjoyed what happened. In fact, it's comforting. If you'd like, even, we could...explore those feelings."

"E-explore?" Mira almost falls over, but Voski helps keep her steady. "Like dating? Is-are you okay with that, Voski?"

"Yeah! Something that makes my girlfriend happy and my friend happy's great! Even if you two don't stay together, it can be fun!"

"I'm your friend?" Mira looks up hopefully. 

"If you'll have us, of course." Seren smiles, relaxed for the first time in the conversation. "And as Voski mentioned, there's no pressure for a long term relationship. Just...seeing how it goes. I'll admit, I lack experience in these kinds of things."

"Oh, so do I!" Mira sits up in Voski's grasp. "I haven't gone on dates before, but it sounds nice."

"Woo!" Voski lets out a mix between a shout and a howl. "You wanna date me too?"

"Voski!" Seren looks both annoyed and embarrassed as she slams a hand down.

"It's fine!" Mira gives a nervous smile. "I was honestly wondering myself."

Seren sighs. "Okay, but I did ask Voski to wait before asking."

"Sorry, I thought you meant after she said yeah."

"I meant *some time* after. Not immediately."

"A-anyways, what do we do now?" Mira speaks up, looking between the two.

Seren relaxes and slides closer to the other two, placing a hand on one of Voski's arms that are wrapped around Mira. "I owe you a shirt, so I thought you and I could go on a shopping date this weekend."

"That sounds great!" Mira gives a bright smile before frowning and looking up at Voski. "Uh, Voski, can I use your appearance on dates?"

"Works for me!"

Seren frowns. "You're watching for everyone else's barriers, aren't you?"

Mira looks away. "It's still their bodies, and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable or cause any confusion. I could ask the others, but it'd be embarrassing. Plus, I don't know what you're fine with."

"I suppose that's fair..." Seren stops for a moment to think. "I'd like to propose something. I initially declined your request to use my appearance because said appearance can cause...issues for you if you were mistaken for me. If we were together, however, I'd have a chance to clarify. In those cases, my appearance shouldn't be an issue. So if you'd like, you may use my appearance whenever we're together."

"I'd-really?" Mira looks wide-eyed and eyes watering, a confused frown on her face. "T-thank you."

Voski chuckles. "Serbear's been feeling bad about saying no for a while now, and got all embarrassed thinking about going on dates with you in matching looks."

Mira smiles wide and lets out a small laugh of her own as Seren puts her head into her hands. "I must warn you, Voski is dangerously honest, especially if you're close with her..."

"I think I'll enjoy the honesty." Mira beams as she shifts into Seren's form, causing the other two to blush at the sight.

"How's she so cute, Ser?"

"I wish I knew, Voski."

Mira blushes, tears falling, but smile persisting. "Thank you, you two. I'll do my best."

"As will we." Seren nods, then places a hand on Mira's lap. "Would you like some time alone, or for one or both of us to stay longer?"

"It it okay if you and I talk for a little longer? Sorry V-"

"No problem! I understand alone time. Don't drain her too bad, Serbear!"

Both Seren and Mira blush deeply as Voski stands and leaves the room with a wide grin. "You...get used to that, eventually."

"I'm sure." Mira giggles. "But uhm, I was wondering if we could cuddle again? You can uh, feed too, if you'd like."

"While I appreciate the offer, I'll end up bloated. And you don't need to be drained too frequently." Seren wraps her arms around Mira, slightly perturbed by seeing herself. "Just cuddling will do." With that, she leans to lead the two down into the bed.
