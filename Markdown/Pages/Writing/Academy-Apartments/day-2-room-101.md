Tin enters her room late into the afternoon after her first day of classes, finding the other four already there. Voski and Seren are together on the couch, while Aria and Mira, using Aria's appearance, are on the chairs.

"...hey?" Tin looks around at the room confusedly.

"Hey, Tintin. We're just going to talk chores and stuff." Aria gives a lazy wave.

"Ser came up with the idea to wait, since we all have different schedules!" Voski wraps an arm around Seren and holds her tightly while she averts her gaze.

"Oh, sounds good. S'alright if I take the couch?"

"Yes, that's fine. Voski, please let me go." Voski obliges as Tin sits beside her.

"So how are we doing this? I'm an only child, so I never really had to worry about stuff like this." Aria looks to Seren, who scratches the back of her head.

"I...admittedly lack experience as well."

"I've got lots of siblings, but we didn't clean much, heheh." Voski pipes up with a grin before looking at Mira. "You have a sister, right? How'd you handle em?"

"Ah, uhm, we played games for them...but I'd rather not." She shifts uncomfortably, ruffling her feathers.

"How about we just take what we want?" Tin speaks up, looking confused. "My brother and I split up chores by what we could do, and then we just talked it out if we could both do them."

"I'm cool with it, but it's probably going to be tougher for us to decide can and can't. Half of us can fly, and I don't think there's anything underwater to do." Aria shrugs.

Tin nods. "I know, it'll mostly be volunteering what you don't mind doing. It's easier when your brother's a fish."

"We have anything that needs some muscle? Because I've got it!" Voski flexes proudly.

"Taking out the trash, maybe?" Mira speaks up while deep in thought, idly shifting forms.

"I believe it'd be better suited for helping sweep by lifting the furniture so one can go underneath." Seren contemplates with a hand on her chin.

"Ooh, yeah, I like that! But I get pretty unbalanced lifting things with one hand..." Voski tilts her head, thinking of a solution.

"I think that's why they said help sweep." Aria lets out an easy laugh. "I'll handle the actual sweeping with you."

"Awesome!" Voski's tail wags in response.

"Regarding the trash...I think it best if we leave it to someone who lacks a sensitive sense of smell." Seren looks to Tin and Mira, who quickly shifts into Tin upon being noted.

"I've got it." Tin speaks up first, right as Mira started to open her mouth. "I always did it for my family, since I was the only one who could head out easily."

Seren nods. "I can handle the bathroom, if Mira doesn't mind the kitchen."

"I don't mind!" Mira looks surprised, but happy. "Is that all the chores?"

"I think so. Anything else we need to talk about?" Aria looks around.

"That should be all, thank you. If you'll excuse me, I have evening classes to attend." Seren then rises and leaves.

Some time later, Tin spots Seren while taking out the trash. The two look at each other for a moment before Seren speaks up.

"Good evening, Tin."

"Hey. Classes go well?"

"Yes, they were as expected. Do you mind if ask a somewhat personal question?"

Tin squints, but eventually nods as she hefts a garbage bag into the nearby dumpster. "Shoot."

"Did you volunteer for the trash for Mira's sake? More specifically, due to her past relationship with chores?"

"Yeah, it's kind of obvious her sister doesn't treat her right. Isn't that why you volunteered for the bathroom?"

Seren hesitates, then nods. "Yes, I came to the same conclusion and acted accordingly. I would have volunteered my appearance as well...but it would have been trouble for her, not help." They look away, uncomfortable.

"Mm." Tin idly stands for a moment before shrugging. "I won't pry, everyone's got where they're coming from. And be careful not to mix things when cleaning the bathroom."

"Ah, right, I have heard of that." Seren scratches the back of their head. "You are quite observant, Tin."

"Eh, I had to get creative in understanding people. I can't speak to most of my family, so I have to find other ways." She lets out a long sigh.

"It sounds...difficult. And yet you went so far as to negotiate chores with your brother?"

"We both know sign. I honestly had it easy. He was willing to go through the effort, even though he rarely saw me. Maybe because of that." Tin laughed to herself. "He even said he plans on visiting at some point, and I could tell he means it."

Seren smiles, relaxing. "I look forward to meeting him, if he does come and visit. Now, should we head back inside?"

"Yeah, I know Voski's waiting for you."

"And Aria's likely waiting for you as well, right?"

"Right."
