## What do you read?
I mostly read manga (shoutout to the Shonen Jump app), though I've been reading novels more often too! I love cool power systems and action involving it. I am also, just an absolute sucker for romance, whether that it is the main focus or a part of it.

## What manga do you read?
It's mostly shonen lol. I've had a Shonen Jump app subscription since college and have used it to catch up on things (shoutout to Yu-Gi-Oh, the reason I got it) or read new stuff weekly (oh my GOODNESS Kagurabachi is so good). I do enjoy yuri as well, and have ended up with a reputation among my friends for it lmfao.

## What novels do you read?
As of 2025? Pretty much just Brandon Sanderson, but I intend to tackle more. I got back into novels with Mistborn, and I've caught up with the Stormlight Archive after that.
