## What do I listen to?
Uhhhhh a lot, lol. I don't really have a favorite genre, and I can't solidly tell you what my preferences are. You can judge me by my [Bandcamp collection](https://bandcamp.com/the-stella-nova), I don't care. My favorite artist is [Jhariah](https://jhariah.bandcamp.com/music), who doesn't help the issue with their thing being "No Genre, All Drama." Always makes bangers, though, go listen to [Trust Ceremony](https://jhariah.bandcamp.com/album/trust-ceremony).

## You mention Bandcamp a lot
Yeah, I do. I like supporting artists, and I recently (Sept 2025) completely stopped using Spotify for...a number of reasons, so I've committed to owning my music physically and digitally, which Bandcamp helps on both fronts.
