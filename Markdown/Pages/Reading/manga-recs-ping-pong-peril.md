## Have You Ever Played Ping-Pong With Your Life On the Line?

Being silly aside, Ping-Pong Peril's a pretty neat manga that ended recently! Pretty normal teenage boy is in stuck with an absolutely ridiculous debt threatening the lives of him and his little sister. Then, an opportunity for freedom: Ping-Pong Peril, a borderline anything-goes form of Ping-Pong with huge stakes!

It's only 17 chapters, but a fun experience nonetheless! Taira is very compelling, and I none of the matches felt repetitive. It managed to even surprise me, and if you're fine with a vague spoiler:

||I described the surprise as a normal ping-pong manga introducing Ping-Pong Peril when talking about it to a friend. Like it's slightly foreshadowed *I guess* but it's such a jump that I was like the hell? I still dug it, though.||(Vague Late Ping-Pong Peril Spoilers)

If you like a little absurdity and some heart, go check it out! It's on Shonen Jump.
