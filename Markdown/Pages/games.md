## What do I play?
That is...a heck of a question. I've been a big fan of videogames since I was a kid (shoutout to Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime, literally defined me) and I've gotten into TCGs as of late. On the TCG front, I'm mainly playing Magic, Star Wars Unlimited, Altered, and Riftbound. I'll also play some Pokémon on Live or with friends every now and then.

On the videogame front...I'm a sucker for racing and fighting games, but I honestly haven't played any much lately (blame that on online tcg clients lol). I've been making my way through Deltarune and enjoying it a lot. I surprisingly haven't been spoiled *that* much.
