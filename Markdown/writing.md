# Writer's Room
I like to write, and here's where you can find different settings or writing projects I have going on.

## [Academy Apartments](Pages/Writing/academy-apartments.html)
Made for me to have a go-to setting, Academy Apartments is an urban fantasy thing focused on the residents of a small apartment complex and all attending the same university. Basically a slice of life but also there's vampires and werewolves and Mira (I like Mira).

## [Acceptance](Pages/Writing/acceptance.html)
A longform story in a modern setting where monsters and powers are introduced to it. This is an ongoing story where I plan to delve into the characters' personal issues and the mystery of what happened to the world.
