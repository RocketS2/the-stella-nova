# Stella's Observatory
Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Stella, a 20+ year old trans woman (she/her) who's into programming and games. Feel free to take a look around!

While I don't make a lot of personal posts elsewhere, I am on [Bluesky](https://the-stella-nova.bsky.social) and [Tumblr](https://integralpiece.tumblr.com). Oh, and if you'd like to see what I listen to, check out my [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/the-stella-nova) profile. Oh, and to follow me on neocities, my link's [here](https://neocities.org/site/the-stella-nova)!

This site's a work in progress! I plan on adding more to it with time, so feel free to check back!

I've recently (like December '25) restructured the site some! Leaning into the whole "I don't wanna post on social media and I have a neocities subscription" thing, the main bit of the site's now the [feed](./feed.html)! Now, instead of trying to categorize all the updates on here into their own pages with essentially their own feeds, there's a one place for them! Also, post previews have been adjusted to feel a little more like social media posts. Fit the vibe, and all.
