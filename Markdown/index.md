## Welcome!
Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Stella, a 20-something year old girl (she/her) who's into programming and games. Feel free to take a look around!

While I don't make a lot of personal posts elsewhere, I am on [Bluesky](https://the-stella-nova.bsky.social) and [Tumblr](https://integralpiece.tumblr.com). Oh, and if you'd like to see what I listen to, check out my [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/the-stella-nova) profile. Oh, and to follow me on neocities, my link's [here](https://neocities.org/site/the-stella-nova)!

This site's a work in progress! I plan on adding more to it with time, so feel free to check back!
