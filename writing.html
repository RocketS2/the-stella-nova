			<h1>Writer's Room</h1>
			<p>I like to write, and here's where you can find different settings or writing projects I have going on.</p>
			<h2><a href="Pages/Writing/academy-apartments.html">Academy Apartments</a></h2>
			<p>Made for me to have a go-to settings, Academy Apartments is an urban fantasy thing focused on the residents of a small apartment complex and all attending the same university. Basically a slice of life but also there's vampires and werewolves and Mira (I like Mira).</p>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Writing/Academy-Apartments/day-1-room-101.html">Day 1 - Room 101 - Feb 11 26</a></strong><p>A young human woman lets out a long sigh. "Hah...alright, let's do this." She looks up at the weathered building in front of her. She can't even tell how old it is, with vines and roots and moss covering what looks like the entirety of the exterior. Despite the crowded exterior, she finds the door easily and steps inside.</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small><small>Room 101</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Writing/academy-apartments.html">Academy Apartments - Feb 11 26</a></strong><p>In a world both like and unlike ours, a group of young adult students all chose the same apartment complex to stay in for their first year of university. They don't know each other, but they'll deal with each other throughout the year!</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small></footer></blockquote>

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
