			<h1>Stella's Observatory</h1>
			<p>Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Stella, a 20+ year old trans woman (she/her) who's into programming and games. Feel free to take a look around!</p>
			<p>While I don't make a lot of personal posts elsewhere, I am on <a href="https://the-stella-nova.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://integralpiece.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>. Oh, and if you'd like to see what I listen to, check out my <a href="https://bandcamp.com/the-stella-nova">Bandcamp</a> profile. Oh, and to follow me on neocities, my link's <a href="https://neocities.org/site/the-stella-nova">here</a>!</p>
			<p>This site's a work in progress! I plan on adding more to it with time, so feel free to check back!</p>
			<p>I've recently (like December '25) restructured the site some! Leaning into the whole "I don't wanna post on social media and I have a neocities subscription" thing, the main bit of the site's now the <a href="./feed.html">feed</a>! Now, instead of trying to categorize all the updates on here into their own pages with essentially their own feeds, there's a one place for them! Also, post previews have been adjusted to feel a little more like social media posts. Fit the vibe, and all.</p>

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
