			<h2>Another Bandcamp Friday!</h2>
			<p>Iiiiiiit's Bandcamp Friday, baby! For those who don't know, Bandcamp Friday is when Bandcamp waives its revenue shares and all that cash heads to the artists. I'm a big fan of using Bandcamp and a big fan of supporting artists, so I usually use this day to clear out my wishlist some. Turns out I discovered a lot of artists I already like and formerly listened to on Spotify this past month, so don't be surprised to see me mention knowing a song or two. Here's what I picked up today:</p>
			<h2><a href="https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/album/unstable">UNSTABLE - The Garages</a></h2>
			<p>I'm very pleasantly familiar with this album. A good while ago, I heard one of the songs from it somewhere and ended up saving the whole album on Spotify and listening a <em>lot</em>, especially to INCINERATE. I'm so happy to have mp3s for this and the ability to listen to it anywhere.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://andresmusica.bandcamp.com/album/adventures-of-a-diy-astronaut">Adventures of a DIY Astronaut - Andrès</a></h2>
			<p>YEAHHHHHHHHHH, I can't <em>tell</em> you how hyped I was to see Andrès on Bandcamp. A friend got me into him through <a href="https://andresmusica.bandcamp.com/track/darth-binks-2">Darth Binks</a> (not on this album, funnily enough), which she assigned to an oc of mine (do NOT think about this further). I ended up listening to so much of him on Spotify, and this is the start of me building up my collection. Now, why Adventures of a DIY Astronaut? Well, two songs I ended up listening to a bunch was Champagne Golfer and My Future Ex Wife (which also fits the aforementioned oc, imo), so I went with the album that had two songs I like.</p>
			<p>And man, do I feel like a fool for not listening to it all earlier! The whole album bangs, just as I expected. The messed up things I'll hear and jam to because of this man is ridiculous. V much look forward to picking up the rest of his stuff over time.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/album/sunbather-10th-anniversary-remix-remaster">Sunbather: 10th Anniversary Remix / Remaster - Deafheaven</a></h2>
			<p>I actually picked up the casette for this one! (Oh my GOODNESS I was worried that they'd run out before I picked it up today.) My friend and roommate from college was a music major who got me into all kinds of music, including this! I think he just sent me Dream House and there's just...something about it, I don't know. It always makes me emotional, like I was near tears relistening randomly. Can hit me regardless of mood, so of course I had to pick up the whole album.</p>
			<p>As for the rest of the album, damn is it all good. I realized immediately that the second song of the album, Irrestible, is one I listened to before as well. There's something chilling about its calmness that I enjoy. I don't plan on going song-by-song, but I enjoyed them all similarly. There's an interesting pace of long and short songs as the album goes on. It almost feels like they're playing with me, mixing short and long or screaming and silence. I genuinely had to check and make sure my player hadn't changed songs suddenly and I'm about it. Highly recommend, and I look forward to the casette arriving in a couple weeks.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://mspainthattiesburg.bandcamp.com/album/s-t">S/T - MSPAINT</a></h2>
			<p>Shoutout to the college roommate again! He and I went to a concert with them, one of the last the two of us went to before graduating, even. It was absolutely sick, and Hardwired was stuck in my head (maybe even hardwired to my brain) for days on end. Listening at home rather than at a concert where I can be sure to hear and process just it only makes me appreciate the songs even more, though <em>man</em> is it not as hype than seeing them in person.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://minasheep.bandcamp.com/album/puppygirl-forever">PUPPYGIRL FOREVER - MinaSheep</a></h2>
			<p>This one's a new one, actually! I'm already familiar with MinaSheep through the <a href="https://minasheep.bandcamp.com/album/dont-think-so-good-ep">DON'T THINK / SO GOOD EP</a>, but I wanted to listen to more! The whole album's very fun, she continues to make music that makes me want to jump around and I'm quite happy about it.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://mykoll.bandcamp.com/track/nothing-ever-changes">Nothing Ever Changes - Mykoll</a></h2>
			<p>Something truly new! A friend mentioned the song in a server so I gave it a listen and dug a good bit, checking for a Bandcamp and being glad to have found one! The song's good and I look forward to listening and picking up more, ideally on a Bandcamp Friday where I hadn't already lined up like 30 bucks worth of stuff.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://paperaviator.bandcamp.com/album/i-dont-wanna-leave-w">i don't wanna leave ;w; - paper aviator</a></h2>
			<p>Another pair of new to me songs! I happened to see a post <em>today</em> about this, so I decided to give it a listen. And I'm glad I did! Both are very pleasant and I now have someone else I look forward to new stuff from.</p>
			<p>I really appreciate the titular track and what it's about. The safe option being to leave so much you love is...a painfully real thing, down in the US South. There's a very comfortable feel to the song, from the calm of the music to the light buzziness you'll hear throughout, even when it builds up. It makes me want to sit outside and feel the sun.</p>
			<p>The choice to have "just a second !" as a b-side is an interesting one! If it wasn't for reading the album page, I wouldn't have guessed that the two had such separate origins. It's fun and feels like a fitting companion to "i don't wanna leave !"</p>
			<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
			<p>Wow music can make me feel a bit emotional, lol. Between old stuff that I've listened to on loop before and new things inciting all new feelings, I'm pretty damn happy with my collection so far and what I've added to it.</p>
