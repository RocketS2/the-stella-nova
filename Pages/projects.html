			<h2>What do I do?</h2>
			<p>
				That is an excellent question! I'm a big fan of programming, to the extent that it's my job. I also write sometimes, usually in roleplays with friends, though I'm planning to do more outside of that.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Programming</h2>
			<p>
				Most of my personal projects programming wise is in the form of discord bots, those users you'll see in servers that let you do commands and such. I'll make them by request to help with a friend's roleplay or anything else, though my pride and joy is AnyDice. She's made for rolling dice, and I've been working on her and adding stuff to her since <em>2021</em>. If you want to try her out for yourself, the bot is public and available <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=840651749215830068">here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Outside of that, I don't really do much just yet but plan to do more. I've dabbled with different game engines, and my newest project (as of late September 2025) is actually <a href="../Pages/Projects/Programming/observatory.html">this site</a>, funnily enough. There's a lot more than html and css going on behind the scenes, but I'll get to that on its own page someday.

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
