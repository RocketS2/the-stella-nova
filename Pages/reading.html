			<h2>What do you read?</h2>
			<p>
				I mostly read manga (shoutout to the Shonen Jump app), though I've been reading novels more often too! I love cool power systems and action involving it. I am also, just an absolute sucker for romance, whether that it is the main focus or a part of it.

			<h2>What manga do you read?</h2>
			<p>
				It's mostly shonen lol. I've had a Shonen Jump app subscription since college and have used it to catch up on things (shoutout to Yu-Gi-Oh, the reason I got it) or read new stuff weekly (oh my GOODNESS Kagurabachi is so good). I do enjoy yuri as well, and have ended up with a reputation among my friends for it lmfao.
			</p>
			
			<h2>What novels do you read?</h2>
			<p>
				As of 2025? Pretty much just Brandon Sanderson, but I intend to tackle more. I got back into novels with Mistborn, and I've caught up with the Stormlight Archive after that.

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
