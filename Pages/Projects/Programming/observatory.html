			<h2>You're Here!</h2>
			<p>Yes, this website is another project of mine, though it doesn't seem so special. Just mind my &lt;p&gt;s and &lt;q&gt;s and all that, right?</p>
			<p>Well, not exactly. Both because I didn't want to deal with a bunch of html tags while writing and because I'm a fan of taking hours writing a program to do something that isn't actually that much trouble, I went for a different approach. This, and every other page of my site, is written in Markdown (basically the same as discord formatting). A python program crawls through the markdown files and converts them all to html. This means I get to write as though I were rambling to a friend instead of trying to write clean html with indentation and all that.</p>
			<p>Also, I added some <em>special features</em>. These are things not actually in Markdown but added for my own convenience. You may have noticed that some pages have previews for other pages on them. That's part of my custom stuff. Instead of manually checking and re-adding, I just put <code>&lt; Folder Number</code> in and the code handles it. I'd demonstrate here but uh...a consequence of how I do it is that it only works for grabbing things on a deeper folder level than the current page, and I did not want to deal with the implications of ordering retrieving file info just for me to demonstrate here. You can see it in the All Pages section of <a href="../../../Pages/projects.html">Projects</a>. I also have a tag system on the bottom of each page (which isn't included in the output, lol) that handles things like the title of the page or the keywords you see under a preview.</p>
			<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with this! I have a place to put my thoughts, and it keeps me sharp as I mess with the conversion file to include new features or fix bugs (I also use a silly amount of RegEx with it).</p>

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
