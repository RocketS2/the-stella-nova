			<h1>It's The Cheapest Option</h1>
			<p>In a world both like and unlike ours, a group of young adult students all chose the same apartment complex to stay in for their first year of university. They don't know each other, but they'll deal with each other throughout the year!</p>
			<p>I hope that hook hooked ya, because I had no idea what I was doing. AA's here to be a flexible setting for me to mess around in. There's no big focus on canon or sequences of events (unless otherwise stated), and it's all for fun.</p>
			<h2>Stories</h2>

Voski and Seren are together on the couch, while Aria and Mira, using Aria's appearance, are on the chairs.</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small><small>Room 101</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="../../Pages/Writing/Academy-Apartments/day-1-room-101.html">Day 1 - Room 101 - Feb 11 26</a></strong><p>A young human woman lets out a long sigh. "Hah...alright, let's do this." She looks up at the weathered building in front of her. She can't even tell how old it is, with vines and roots and moss covering what looks like the entirety of the exterior. Despite the crowded exterior, she finds the door easily and steps inside.</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small><small>Room 101</small></footer></blockquote>

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
