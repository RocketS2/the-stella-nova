			<h1>If You Wish To Gain It, You Must Accept It</h1>
			<p>Everyone in the world heard the words. Waking or sleeping, it did not matter. The phrase meant something that came to be understood quickly: if you wish to have the power that is offered to you, you have to embrace it, good and bad. There's pressure to accept, too. On the same day that the world heard The Message, the Beasts came to be: monsters that appear first in dreams before reappearing in the waking world.</p>
			<p>Xinnia was asleep for the end of the world and forced into a rude awakening. There is no way that she can handle this, but she has to Accept that she will make it Be.</p>
			<p>This is a longer form story! I want something with cool powers and some Themes, so I plan to work on this for a while. The below feed's ordered oldest to newest, so scroll to the bottom for the latest!</p>

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
