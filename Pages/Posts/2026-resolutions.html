			<h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
			<p>It's 2026, and I feel like looking forward. Something's different, I don't know. I'd usually feel content to stay the same, but I feel better this year! So yeah, I'm making resolutions, and I want to write them down so that I can remember them. And spoilers, one of them's involving this site. </p>
			<h2>Experiencing</h2>
			<p>First off, let's talk things I want to play/read/watch/whatever. These are less of like, aspirational goals and more "wow I need a more established backlog so that it's not just another 225 hours in MtG Arena again.”</p>
			<h3>Game On!</h3>
			<p>Unbeatable's a sick rhythm game that I've been looking forward to, and I plan on finishing the story this year. I would've done it like, immediately after I got it for Christmas, but I'm on linux and was going through it. I learned the necessary setup, but even the credits were being funky, so I plan on waiting. I'll still be hitting up the arcade mode repeatedly in the meantime, though. </p>
			<p>Oh, and Deltarune! I still haven't finished chapter 4, partially because of forgetting and partially because I stream for friends and have to schedule. Very cool game, and I heard we're getting more this year, so maybe I'll play a chapter day one for once. </p>
			<p>Other than that...I don't really have many hard commitment or desires to game. There's plenty of neat things, like In Stars and Time, Another Crab's Treasure, Pepper Grinder, and Halo, but I'm not like, super eager. <s>Tbh I really dig Pepper Grinder but I've gotten pissed like three times on the first boss so I do not want to commit just to be here in 365 days talking about how I got whooped.</s></p>
			<h3>Reading and Weeping</h3>
			<p>In case it wasn't obvious, I love me some Brandon Sanderson. I've caught up on Stormlight and Mistborn and have also read Warbreaker, but I'm not done. I bought Yumi and the Nightmare Painter a while ago, and uh. Forgot to read it lol. I got started but not far, and it seems neat! I doubt I need a year to read one book, considering how both Mistborn and Stormlight were done in their own respective years, so I'll probably tackle Tress and Fires of December since they're all Hoid's Travails from what I've heard. Also Elantris, since it's gonna be part of the Cosmere RPG.</p>
			<p>I do think I can read more than 4 books, though, and I have a lot of visual novels I ought to get through, so I'm going to say Tsukihime, MAMIYA, and Tasokare Hotel at the very least. The former comes highly recommended by a friend <s>and other friends she got to read it</s>, and I literally read one of the routes a few years back and just never got back to it. And I lost my progress swapping computers. The latter two are also recommended by a friend and literally everyone else who read them off the recommendation. One of said friends read MAMIYA <em>off of my purchasing it through family share.</em> I gotta lock in, man.</p>
			<p>Also, while more aimless, I want to finish at least one comic run of Spider-man, X-men, and something with Cloak and Dagger. This is partially because I haven't touched my Marvel Unlimited subscription and let it auto-renew, but also man they're cool characters that I want to know more about! I've been a Spidey fan since I was a kid, a friend has told me a bunch about the X-men, and I played Cloak and Dagger for the few months I played Marvel Rivals.</p>
			<h3>Watching and…</h3>
			<p>Okay, to be honest I don't have real strong feelings on watching anything this year. Beyond the Spider-verse isn't until 2027, and otherwise there's nothing I'm really looking forward to seeing? I'll say Pluribus and Sinners since I've heard from friends that I gotta.</p>
			<h2>Learning!</h2>
			<p>I want to know more, as I think everyone ought to. <em>Now</em> we're into more tangible goal territory. I'm not dedicating a paragraph to it, but I definitely plan on learning something computer-related, being my job and a huge hobby of mine.</p>
			<p>Funnily enough, both goals have to do with languages! I want to learn French and ASL, for their own reasons. French is because I plan to move to Canada, and <em>wow</em> if it ain't required, it sure boosts your chances at getting there and a job. ASL is because...well man it's useful! I don't need to but I've <em>been</em> meaning to, goodness. It's nice to know, and I should've done so already.</p>
			<p>Actually, you know what, third thing came to mind. I want to actually learn Godot to a degree that it's tangible. This isn't the same as the computer related goal, that's going to be something like React. I want to learn how to make videogames, and Godot's cool from the little I've dabbled in it. I'm going to say the same for Ren'Py for the exact same reasons.</p>
			<h2>Creating…</h2>
			<p>Okay, this is the big one. I want to <em>make</em> stuff. It's always a desire that comes up, either randomly or because I get inspired by something. With that being said, I've finished like no projects. Lots of ideas, but no results, and I want to change that!</p>
			<p>Funnily enough, I'm going to start with one that doesn't actually have a natural "finished” state: this website. I plan to make at least one post a month (but ideally like, more than that lol) for a total of 12 this year. I've already got one done in this article, but plan to do a lot more, such as discussing the things mentioned here.</p>
			<p>Now, I'm going to go into two nebulous goals: write a story and make a videogame. I've had plenty of ideas for both over the years, but never really <em>finished</em> any. Hey, remember how I just mentioned tangibly learning Godot and Ren'Py? I think I know good applications of both. I don't know what I want to make yet, but I want ro have something down this time next year.</p>
			<p>Now, the biggest one of all: make a Trading Card Game. While it was initially just going to be another scattered idea, the encouragement of another and my desire to finish combined to really push me to do this. I started a week or so ago, and the end goal's just to play with two prebuilt decks with the one who encouraged me by looking forward to seeing what comes of it. I won't say much since it's still early, but we'll see how it goes.</p>
			<h2>Final? Beginning? Thoughts</h2>
			<p>Wow, I put a lot up there. It's honestly daunting to look at, especially since I added things as I was writing, but I know it's all things I can do. I look forward to this year, and look forward to talking about all the things up here.</p>
