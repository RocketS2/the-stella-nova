			<h2>Megas are back, baby!</h2>
			<p>
				I chose an absolutely amazing year to get back into PTCG. I've played it on occasion in the past, downloading Online in middle school and buying a battle academy with my roommate in college, but I didn't truly get into it until Pocket released. Pocket itself isn't what makes this year amazing for me, though. We got a super eevee focused set (my fave mon, btw) and a set focusing back on gen 6 and MEGAS, it's sick!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The card I was most looking forward to, and immediately build a deck around, was Mega Gardevoir Ex. I already had a Mewtwo Ex deck, and this one's just plain better. An energy from the deck for each bench mon vs 2 from discard, 50 damage for each psychic energy vs 30, and the most offensive part (imo) being that Mega Symphonia costs 1 energy <em>less</em> than Photon Kinesis. Actual absurdity. So yeah, I built a deck day 1 (or I guess -1, since it released on Live a day earlier than paper).

				As a fun little deckbuilding restriction, I only used cards from the new set (aside from energies, since Live wanted to act like there were none). It's as follows (thank goodness I remembered Live lets you export):
			</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				<strong>Pokémon: 9</strong><br>1 Kirlia MEG 59 PH<br>2 Xerneas MEG 64<br>2 Mega Kangaskhan ex MEG 164<br>3 Kirlia MEG 59<br>2 Mega Gardevoir ex MEG 159<br>1 Delibird MEG 105<br>2 Mega Gardevoir ex MEG 60<br>4 Ralts MEG 58<br>1 Delibird MEG 105 PH<br><br><strong>Trainer: 10</strong><br>2 Buddy-Buddy Poffin PRE 101<br>4 Lillie's Determination MEG 119<br>2 Switch MEG 130<br>2 Wally's Compassion MEG 132<br>2 Ultra Ball BRS 150<br>2 Rare Candy GRI 165<br>2 Boss's Orders RCL 154<br>2 Mega Signal MEG 121<br>4 Mystery Garden MEG 122<br>2 Pokémon Center Lady MEG 123<br><br><strong>Energy: 1</strong><br>18 Basic {P} Energy Energy 49<br><br><strong>Total Cards:</strong> 60
			</blockquote>

				Basically, the gameplan is get Mega Gardevoir Ex out, throw on some energies, and start swinging ridiculously hard. Almost every card here helps make sure we can get Mega Gardevoir Ex...to an extent that that sums up most of the deck lol. Some cards I'm particularly fond of are Lillie's Determination, Wally's Compassion, and Mystery Garden.

				Lillie's Determination shuffles your hand into your deck, then draws 6 unless you have all 6 prize cards, then it draws 8. Fun alternative to Professor's Research that's stronger early on. Wally's Compassion fully heals a Mega Evolution Pokémon <strong><em>ex</em></strong> (goodness that's wordy) and puts all the attached energy on it into your hand. Do you know how trivial of a downside that is for Gardevoir? Miss "I'm going to deal 450 damage with 1 energy on me"? Ridiculous, love it. Also the art's v nice, love my boy Wally. Mystery Garden has been of no help to me so far but I dig it conceptually. Discard an energy to draw until you have cards in hand equal to the number of psychic mons in play. Neat bit of card draw, I just misread it as drawing as many cards as psychic mons in play and played it at bad times.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Overall, pretty fun! I dig the cards in the new set and I can't complain about X and Y getting more love. The Lucario Ex deck they give you in Live is <em>nasty,</em> by the way.
