Something's different, I don't know. I'd usually feel content to stay the same, but I feel better this year! So yeah, I'm making resolutions, and I want to write them down so that I can remember them. And spoilers, one of them's involving this site. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Reading/manga-recs-ping-pong-peril.html">Recently Ended Manga Recs: Ping-Pong Peril - Nov 12 25</a></strong><p>Being silly aside, Ping-Pong Peril's a pretty neat manga that ended recently! Pretty normal teenage boy is in stuck with an absolutely ridiculous debt threatening the lives of him and his little sister. Then, an opportunity for freedom: Ping-Pong Peril, a borderline anything-goes form of Ping-Pong with huge stakes!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Games/TCGs/Riftbound/excited-for-riftbound.html">Why I'm Excited for Riftbound - Oct 21 25</a></strong><p>So Riftbound is a new TCG based off the game League of Legends, and I am so incredibly hype. I'm not a League fan, mind you, the game's just that cool. I heard about the rules sometime early to mid 2025 (this is being written the week before it releases on Halloween 2025), and played it with folks at my local game store when the demo decks come in. And let me tell you, I've only gotten more excited each time I've played.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Music/bandcamp-friday-oct-3-2025.html">Bandcamp Friday - Oct 03 25</a></strong><p>Iiiiiiit's Bandcamp Friday, baby! For those who don't know, Bandcamp Friday is when Bandcamp waives its revenue shares and all that cash heads to the artists. I'm a big fan of using Bandcamp and a big fan of supporting artists, so I usually use this day to clear out my wishlist some. Turns out I discovered a lot of artists I already like and formerly listened to on Spotify this past month, so don't be surprised to see me mention knowing a song or two. Here's what I picked up today:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Projects/Programming/observatory.html">The Observatory - Sep 29 25</a></strong><p>Yes, this website is another project of mine, though it doesn't seem so special. Just mind my &lt;p&gt;s and &lt;q&gt;s and all that, right?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Games/TCGs/Pokemon/mega-evolution.html">PTCG: Mega Evolution Release - Sep 27 25</a></strong><p>I chose an absolutely amazing year to get back into PTCG. I've played it on occasion in the past, downloading Online in middle school and buying a battle academy with my roommate in college, but I didn't truly get into it until Pocket released. Pocket itself isn't what makes this year amazing for me, though. We got a super eevee focused set (my fave mon, btw) and a set focusing back on gen 6 and MEGAS, it's sick!</p></blockquote>
