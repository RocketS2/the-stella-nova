Voski and Seren are together on the couch, while Aria and Mira, using Aria's appearance, are on the chairs.</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small><small>Room 101</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Writing/Academy-Apartments/day-1-room-101.html">Day 1 - Room 101 - Feb 11 26</a></strong><p>A young human woman lets out a long sigh. "Hah...alright, let's do this." She looks up at the weathered building in front of her. She can't even tell how old it is, with vines and roots and moss covering what looks like the entirety of the exterior. Despite the crowded exterior, she finds the door easily and steps inside.</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small><small>Room 101</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Writing/academy-apartments.html">Academy Apartments - Feb 11 26</a></strong><p>In a world both like and unlike ours, a group of young adult students all chose the same apartment complex to stay in for their first year of university. They don't know each other, but they'll deal with each other throughout the year!</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Writing</small><small>Academy Apartments</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Posts/2026-resolutions.html">2026 New Year's Resolutions - Jan 01 26</a></strong><p>It's 2026, and I feel like looking forward. Something's different, I don't know. I'd usually feel content to stay the same, but I feel better this year! So yeah, I'm making resolutions, and I want to write them down so that I can remember them. And spoilers, one of them's involving this site. </p><footer class="keywords"><small>Personal</small><small>Projects</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Posts/manga-recs-ping-pong-peril.html">Recently Ended Manga Recs: Ping-Pong Peril - Nov 12 25</a></strong><p>Being silly aside, Ping-Pong Peril's a pretty neat manga that ended recently! Pretty normal teenage boy is in stuck with an absolutely ridiculous debt threatening the lives of him and his little sister. Then, an opportunity for freedom: Ping-Pong Peril, a borderline anything-goes form of Ping-Pong with huge stakes!</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Reading</small><small>Manga</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Posts/excited-for-riftbound.html">Why I'm Excited for Riftbound - Oct 21 25</a></strong><p>So Riftbound is a new TCG based off the game League of Legends, and I am so incredibly hype. I'm not a League fan, mind you, the game's just that cool. I heard about the rules sometime early to mid 2025 (this is being written the week before it releases on Halloween 2025), and played it with folks at my local game store when the demo decks come in. And let me tell you, I've only gotten more excited each time I've played.</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Games</small><small>TCGs</small><small>Riftbound</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Posts/bandcamp-friday-oct-3-2025.html">Bandcamp Friday - Oct 03 25</a></strong><p>Iiiiiiit's Bandcamp Friday, baby! For those who don't know, Bandcamp Friday is when Bandcamp waives its revenue shares and all that cash heads to the artists. I'm a big fan of using Bandcamp and a big fan of supporting artists, so I usually use this day to clear out my wishlist some. Turns out I discovered a lot of artists I already like and formerly listened to on Spotify this past month, so don't be surprised to see me mention knowing a song or two. Here's what I picked up today:</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Music</small><small>Bandcamp Friday</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Posts/observatory.html">The Observatory - Sep 29 25</a></strong><p>Yes, this website is another project of mine, though it doesn't seem so special. Just mind my &lt;p&gt;s and &lt;q&gt;s and all that, right?</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Projects</small><small>Programming</small></footer></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong><a href="Pages/Posts/mega-evolution.html">PTCG: Mega Evolution Release - Sep 27 25</a></strong><p>I chose an absolutely amazing year to get back into PTCG. I've played it on occasion in the past, downloading Online in middle school and buying a battle academy with my roommate in college, but I didn't truly get into it until Pocket released. Pocket itself isn't what makes this year amazing for me, though. We got a super eevee focused set (my fave mon, btw) and a set focusing back on gen 6 and MEGAS, it's sick!</p><footer class="keywords"><small>Games</small><small>TCGs</small><small>Pokémon</small></footer></blockquote>

				Header font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/west-end-knights/">West End Knights</a> and general font is <a href="https://chequered.ink/product/figure-things/">Figure Things</a>, both bought from <a href="https://chequered.ink/">Chequered Ink</a>. Big thanks to them!! I recommend getting the <a href="https://ci.itch.io/all-fonts-pack">All Fonts Pack</a> on itch.io like I did (it tends to go on sale).
